## Overview
***
- The purpose of this analysis was to pull in weather data for June and December in Oahu using SQL/SQL Alchemy and determine if a surf and ice cream shot would be a sustainable business year-round. 

## Results
***
- The results outlined the following temperatures for June and December respectively: 
- June: 

- December: 

- As evidenced by the above charts:

     1. June and December temps are both warm with a mean temp of +70 degrees. 
     2. June and December temps are very similar overall with similar mins, max amd percentile ranges (none doffer by more than 10 degrees). 
     3. both June and December had similar and small standard deviations (3 degrees) evidencing that there is not extreme swings in temp. 



## Summary
***
- Overall from a pure temperature standpoint, this looks like the perfect location to open a surf and ice cream shop. That being said, however, its missing two key weather facts that I think should be gathered and taken into account: 

     1. Average wind speed. Usually surfing is better in windy areas as this creates larger waves, having avg wind speed could help make a better determination on the surf component of the business. 
     2. Average precipitation. Both months could have similar temps, but what if there is a rainy season that would limit foot traffic to the ice cream shop? As such rain totals should also be brought in.
